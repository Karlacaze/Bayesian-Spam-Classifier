# Bayesian Classifier – SMS Spam Detection

This project implements a **Naive Bayes classifier** to detect **spam versus legitimate SMS messages** using basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and probabilistic modeling.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate a **simple yet effective approach to text classification**, covering the full workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Project Overview

- Text preprocessing using NLP techniques (tokenization, stopword removal, normalization)
- Feature extraction for text classification
- Naive Bayes probabilistic modeling
- Model evaluation and performance analysis
- Implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and reproducibility

## Technologies & Tools

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **NLTK**
- **Pandas / NumPy**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Dataset

The model is trained on a public SMS dataset containing labeled messages (`spam` or `ham`).  
The dataset is used for educational and demonstration purposes.
